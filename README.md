- I've put this together because many ANSWERS to common and repetitive QUESTIONS can now be found in a simple documentation.
- I've also grown tired of developers using "copy/paste" for readmes, pretending they know how to code. So, I'm demonstrating how to embrace creativity.
- Just to clarify, I'm not a coach, teacher, or planning to sell any courses, nor am I going to start creating viral tweets.
- The tone might sound a bit blunt, but it's all in good fun. I'm just someone who's really focused on good work. üòâ
